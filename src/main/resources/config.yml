# Depending on the surcharge-curve-epsilon, the price-spread will need to be different. A couple values are:
# For surcharge-curve-epsilon = 0, any non-negative price spread "works"
# For surcharge-curve-epsilon = 0.1, price spread should be > 0.195
# For surcharge-curve-epsilon = 0.01, price spread should be > 0.0195 (notice the added 0 for both sides)
# For surcharge-curve-epsilon = 0.05, price spread should be > 0.0975
